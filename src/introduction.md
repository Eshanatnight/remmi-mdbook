## What is a recommender system?

Recommender systems are among the most popular applications of data science today. They are used to predict the "rating" or "preference" that a user would give to an item. Almost every major tech company has applied them in some form. Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers, YouTube uses it to decide which video to play next on autoplay, and Facebook uses it to recommend pages to like and people to follow.

There are also popular recommender systems for domains like restaurants, movies, and online dating. Recommender systems have also been developed to explore research articles and experts, collaborators, and financial services. YouTube uses the recommendation system at a large scale to suggest you videos based on your history. For example, if you watch a lot of educational videos, it would suggest those types of videos.
